OS Labs
These were lab questions related to multi-thread programming, using semaphores and pipes to control concurrent processes' access to a critical section. These were exercises for CS 2106 Operating Systems at National University of Singapore.

fibonacci.c - Pipe practice - Computing fibonacci numbers by spawning new processes
slowincrement.c - Enforce proper icrementing using semaphores when the increment is very slow
farmer.c - The farmer/wolf/sheep/cabbage river crossing problem using semaphores
diningphilosopher.c - The dining philosophers problem implemneted using semaphores

*_p.c - The same problem but implemeted using pipes instead of semaphores
